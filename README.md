# COVID-19-PREDICTION-USING-CONVOLUTIONAL-NEURAL-NETWORK-APPROACH

The coronavirus disease outbreak of 2019 (COVID-19) has impacted the health of many people
around the world. It has developed a difficult situation by bringing life to a standstill throughout
the globe and killing thousands of civilians.Several applications have been developed for analyzing
and detecting the Covid-19 disease. Our proposed system consists of two modules.
1.Prediction of Coronavirus based on basic symptoms using supervised Machine Learning
Algorithmswhich are Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classification.
2.Detection of Covid-19 by applying Convolutional Neural Network on Chest X-ray image
Dataset.
